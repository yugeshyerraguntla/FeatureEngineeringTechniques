Types of Categorical Variables:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Nominal Categorical Vars: No need to worry about arrangement
gender:   State:
Male       AP
Female     TN
           Bihar
           
           
2. Ordinal Categorical Variables:
Need to see about Ranks
Education:
BE, BCom, PhD, Masters

Rearrange as per ranks: PhD-1, Masters-2, BE-3, Bcom-4
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Types of Encoding:
1. Nominal Encoding: 
  a. One Hot Encoding
      - pd.get_dummies()
      - Dummy Vriable Trap - To aviod, delete one of the column
      - Not suggested if values are many
      
  b. One Hot Encoding with Many Variables
      - If we have multiples categories, Consider only few - top 10 or top 20
      
      
  c. Mean Encoding
      - The categories will be replaced with the mean values of their respective output
      
  d. Count/Frequency Encoding
      - Takes the count of the variables and instead of the value, it assigns the counts. 
      - First find counts of the variables, then use MAP function to map the count to the actual variable. - eg: in File 4b
      - Disadvantage is that if there are variables with same counts, the functionality of that variable is replaced.
  
2. Ordinal Encoding:
  a. Label Encoding
      - Assigning ranks to variables (phd-4, me -3, stat-2, be-1)     
  
  b. Target Guided Encoding
      - Take feature and O/p
      - Now for one category, ensure to take the average of the o/p (eg: A:0.83, B:0.6, C:0.2, D:0.4)
      - based of averge values, assign ranks ( eg: A-1, B-2, D-3, C-4)
