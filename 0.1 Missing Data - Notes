What are different types of missing data? and How to handle them? 

1. Missing completely at Random - MCAR:
    Thereâ€™s no relationship between whether a data point is missing and any values in the data set, missing or observed.
    
2. Missing at Random - MAR:
    Missing at Random means  the propensity for a data point to be missing is not related to the missing data, but it is related to some of the observed data.
    
3. Missing Not At Random - MNAR:
    Data are missing not at random when the missing values of a variable are related to the values of that variable itself, even after controlling for other variables.
    
    
HOW TO HANDLE THEM?

NUMERICAL
------------
1. Mean/Median/Mode Replacement - Replace with median or mean
2. Random Sample Imputation - Taking random observations from dataset and use that observation in place of NaN - Use during MCAR (VVIP) Function very good
3. Capturing NaN values with a new feature  - Create another feature(0/1 as values) that tells importance
4. End of Distribution Imputation - Take last values in distribution and replave NaN with that. (USE THIS TO REMOVE OUTLIERS)
5. Arbitrary Imputation -  Replace NaN by Arbitrary Value
6. Frequent Categories Imputation - 


CATEGORICAL - More details in Next Notes File
------------
1. Frequent Categorical Imputation

Nominal Encoding:
2. One Hot Encoding -get_dummies
3. One Hot Encoding with many vars - consider top 10 or top 20 and then get_dummies in Eg:2a
4. Mean Encoding - Eg in 5 last

Ordinal Encoding: - Eg in 2c
5. Label Encoding
6. Target Guided Encoding 
7. Probability Ratio Encoding 


----------------------------------
Feature Scaling:

Using Standardization and Normalization 
Every feature will have Magnitude and Units. Every feature will be different... hence we need to bring them together.

Types Available:
1. Normalization and Standardization
2. Scaling to Minima and maxima
3. Scaling to Median and Quartiles
4. Robust Scaling
5. Guassian Transformation -> If the data is right skewed or left skewed, how to make it guassian? (becoz linear and logistic reg are normally distributed)
    - Logarithamic Transformtion - takes log
    - Reciprocal Transformation  - takes 1/val
    - Square Root Transformtion  - takes sqrt
    - Exponential Transformtion  - df.Age**(1/1.2)
    - Box Cox Transformation     -
